"""This module has the class and functions to format one WhatsApp chat in its entirety.

Classes:
    Message:
        The class for each message in a chat. Every instance is a separate message.

    Chat:
        The class for each chat to be formatted. Every instance is a separate chat.

Functions:
    process_chat(input_file: str, group_chat: bool, sender_name: str, chat_title: str, html_file_name: str, output_dir: str) -> None:
        Process one chat completely.

    process_list_of_chats(list_of_chats: list) -> list:
        Fully format a list of lists, where each sub-list is a set of arguments to be passed to process_chat().

        Returns a list of all the sub-lists that couldn't be processed properly.
